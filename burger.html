<h2>Instructions:</h2></div>
<div class="Steps">Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat.

In a large bowl, gently mix together the ground beef, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder until just combined.<br> Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the burgers tough.<br>

Divide the meat mixture into 4 equal portions, then shape each portion into a patty about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.<br> Make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up while cooking.<br>

Place the patties on the grill or skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or longer if you prefer your burgers more well-done.<br> Make sure to only flip the burgers once to ensure proper cooking.<br>

While the burgers are cooking, you can toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a separate skillet until lightly golden brown.<br>

Once the burgers are cooked to your desired doneness, remove them from the grill or skillet and let them rest for a few minutes.<br>

Assemble your burgers by placing each patty on a toasted bun and adding your favorite toppings.<br>

Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade burgers!<br>

Feel free to customize this recipe by adding different seasonings to the ground beef mixture or experimenting with various toppings to suit your taste preferences.<br></div>
